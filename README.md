# Responsive email template

A table-based (but responsive) email template. Has [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com) merge tags in place. Based on the following work:

* [From Monitor To Mobile: Optimizing Email Newsletters With CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/from-monitor-to-mobile-optimizing-email-newsletters-with-css/)
* [Email Boilerplate](https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate)
* [MailChimp Email Blueprints](https://github.com/mailchimp/email-blueprints)

## Images

Some of the images used within this template are created at double-resolution to give a crisp display on HiDPI screens - please bear in mind this will require extra bandwidth. If you are optimising for lower bandwidths you may want to use standard resolution images instead. Also, images hidden using `display: none;` do still load, even though they are not displayed.

Make sure you link all your images using full URL paths, and upload them to a suitable webspace, or upload/link via your email transmission service.
